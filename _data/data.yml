career-profile:
    title: Who Am I?
    summary: |
      An artist with an engineer's skill set. A creative mind thinking up technical solutions. Forever picking apart things to see how they work, and sometimes reimagining them.
      
      I have always had a strong interest in game development. Beyond simple fun, games are a means of expression, and their construction presents a novel set of puzzles and compromises. Games are a fantastically unique medium, full of possibilities for story-telling and beyond.
      
      I was lucky to get my hands on Scratch during its infancy before eventually graduating to a C# 2008 for Dummies book, where I got my first hands-on practice with writing code. I learned early on that programming isn't about knowing a singular language, but understanding the logic and rules that underpin them.
      
      From there, I began picking apart various open-source C++ game engines, teaching myself since the best we got at school was Visual Basic 6.
      Most recently, I've been picking apart Unreal Engine, discovering and overcoming the innumerable pitfalls that lie within. 
      
      Think you could use someone like me?
